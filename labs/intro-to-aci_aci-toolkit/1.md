# ACI Programmability to Go - ACI Toolkit
Since you already have a high level understanding of the ACI Toolkit, we are now going to do a deeper dive into what it offers by reviewing it's core features and functionality. ACI Toolkit comes with 3 primary tools to interact with ACI:

* A lightweight Python library
* Set of sample scripts
* Several pre-built applications using the toolkit library

First, we are going to provide an introduction to each one of them and review installation procedures, followed by the Toolkit data model, and finally, we'll provide hands-on examples using the Toolkit.

### Toolkit Library
As mentioned in the previous section, the Toolkit is not a full featured library like Cobra. Instead, it seeks to provide easy access to programming the most common tasks when managing an ACI fabric. The toolkit provides a friendlier API (library) by creating more familiar object names to someone who has spent just a little bit of time in the APIC GUI. For instance, the API references a tenant by "fv.Tenant", whereas the ACI Toolkit simply uses "Tenant." Also, since the Toolkit is focused on only the most common tasks, the Python library is much smaller and easier to begin using than the fully functional Cobra package. Here is an example of viewing all Tenants configured:
```python
>>> from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *
>>> from credentials import *
>>> 
>>> session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
>>> session.login()
<Response [200]>
>>> 
>>> tenant_list = Tenant.get(session)
>>> for tenant in tenant_list:
...     print(tenant)
... 
common
infra
mgmt
Heroes
>>> 
```

#### Sample Scripts
The Toolkit also comes with over 40 sample scripts that are ready to be used. These scripts accomplish varying GET, POST, and DELETE tasks, and have varying levels of details required to run. Other network Engineers have also come up with their own scripts and posted them to GitHub. Below is an example of a sample script that prints all tenants and their health.
```bash
$ python acitoolkit/samples/aci-show-tenant-health.py 
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password: 
tenant                                                                 current_health  
---------                                                              ----    
common                                                                 100     
infra                                                                  100     
Heroes                                                                 95      
mgmt                                                                   100 
$ 
```

#### Toolkit Applications
There are several applications that are installed with the Toolkit package. These are more robust then the sample scripts, and often have visual representations instead of just displaying info back to a terminal window. Since these do have more features, sometimes they require additional applications to be installed, such as Flask or MySQL. Some applications are used for historical purposes and should be installed on a server and left running; an example would be endpoint tracker, which keeps record of where and when hosts join and leave the fabric. One of the applications, "object_browser," allows you to browse Managed Objects by either Class or the DN of a MO. This application also returns the data with hyperlinks to make browsing through an object's relationships more convenient.

#### Installation and Documentation
If you are following this lab in your own environment and do not have ACI Toolkit already installed, then follow these instructions. Also, if you are using virtual environments, make sure you are using the correct one.

The Toolkit can be downloaded from GitHub two different ways, or could also be pulled from docker:

*  Downloading the zip file from https://github.com/datacenter/acitoolkit/archive/master.zip and unzipping the contents
*  Using Git: `git clone https://github.com/datacenter/acitoolkit.git`
*  Using Docker: `docker pull dockercisco/acitoolkit`

Once the package is downloaded, installation is as simple as running the setup.py file in the acitoolkit directory:

> Note: `sudo` if required.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/datacint/acitoolkit.git
$ cd acitoolkit
$ ls
acitoolkit           contributors.txt  LICENSE    samples        tests
acitoolkit.egg-info  dist              NOTICE     scripts        Vagrantfile
applications         Dockerfile        pylintrc   setup.py
build                docs              README.md  shippable.yml
$ python setup.py install
several log messages should appear
$ 
```

Documentation for ACI Toolkit can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/datacenter/acitoolkit or at the main documentation site, https://acitoolkit.readthedocs.io. The Read the Docs website has full details of the API, Applications, and a thorough walkthrough on using ACI Toolkit for Monitoring and Statistical information.
