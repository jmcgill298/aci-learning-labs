# ACI Websockets

### What are Websockets?
Websockets are used to enable bi-directional communication between two hosts; often between a web browser (client) and a web server. There are two key distinctions between the WebSocket protocol and HTTP:

1. Websockets enable the server to send and push messages to the client
2. Websockets use a single TCP connection for all communication

Since websockets were designed to add capabilities that HTTP web communications lack, they also use tcp/80 (plain-text) and tcp/443 (encrypted). 

*  **ws://** for plain-text communication
*  **wss://** for encrypted traffic.

### Using Websockets with ACI
ACI enables websockets to allow subscriptions to events happening within the fabric. These events can be creations, deletions, or modifications to Classes or Managed Objects. When an event happens, the APIC generates a push notification to the client(s) subscribed to that Class or Managed Object.

Using ACI's websocket functionality is done by:

1.  Establishing a connection with the APIC
2.  Retrieving the **token** from the APIC's login response
3.  Opening a websocket using the token
4.  Subscribing to events

**Establish a session and retrieve the token**

An easy way to see the the APICs response with the token is to login using Postman. Open Postman and establish a session with the APIC.
```
Method: POST
URL: https://apic/api/aaaLogin.json
Body: {"aaaUser": {"attributes": {"name": "admin","pwd": "password"}}}
```

The token is returned in the response body as "token"

**Use the token to open a websocket**

This token is then used to open a websocket using the following URL:
```
wss://apic/socket%TOKEN%
```
Example:
```
TOKEN = tn8JhCEVpP/3A3wh7isn4M0iHr6HXQiYD0krBnJFltN6rayk1Kl6stULtboCuAb6yFJL3Ehsm3Ceyk0XihyJG45DRmOrJMRKjJ2hNJ6LD7iEQ6Rm1d0UPRSq8/43jXyjlxMSJNgkRI8o++qQeChb8Y5JftD4RG2j0wzlV4osggc=
URL = wss://apic/sockettn8JhCEVpP/3A3wh7isn4M0iHr6HXQiYD0krBnJFltN6rayk1Kl6stULtboCuAb6yFJL3Ehsm3Ceyk0XihyJG45DRmOrJMRKjJ2hNJ6LD7iEQ6Rm1d0UPRSq8/43jXyjlxMSJNgkRI8o++qQeChb8Y5JftD4RG2j0wzlV4osggc=
```

A successful websocket connection will return an HTTP status code of "101." 

**Subscribing to events**

With the websocket open, subscriptions are established using GET requests to the Class or MO URL followed by **subscription=yes**. 

Here are two example GET requests using `subcription=yes`. Refer back to "Peeling Back the ACI API" for more details on making queries to the APIC.

Subscribe to events on the Heroes Tenant:

```
HTTP Method: GET
URL: https://apic/api/mo/uni/tn-Heroes.json?subscription=yes
```

Subscribe to health events across all Tenants:

```
HTTP Method: GET
URL: https://apic/api/class/fvTenant.json?subscription=yes&rsp-subtree-include=health,required
```

Since websockets allows for multiple communication channels over a single TCP session, you can subscribe to multiple Classes and managed objects using the same websocket session.

Each subscription is assigned a unique ID, which allows for each incoming message to be classified. The following is an example of a notification coming from the ACI fabric for the creation of a new Tenant named **Example**:

```
{"subscriptionId":["72057606939672577"],"imdata":[{"fvTenant":{"attributes":{"childAction":"","descr":"","dn":"uni/tn-example","lcOwn":"local","modTs":"2017-02-17T15:23:30.009+00:00","monPolDn":"","name":"example","ownerKey":"","ownerTag":"","rn":"","status":"created","uid":"15374"}}}]}
```

Each subscription has a timeout period of one minute, but can be refreshed using the subscription ID before the session expires. The URL to refresh a subscription is shown here:

```
HTTP Method: GET
URL: https://apic/api/subscriptionRefresh.json?id=subscriptionID
```

Example refreshing the previous subscription:
```
Method: GET
URL: https://apic/api/subscriptionRefresh.json?id=72057606939672577
```

Now that you have an understanding of what websockets are, and how to use them, lets work through some examples of using them with ACI.
