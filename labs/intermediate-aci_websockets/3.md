### Using Websockets with ACIToolkit
ACIToolkit has websocket functionality built into the SDK simplifying the use of websockets with ACI. We will leverage this functionaility to quickly and easily establish a session with the APIC and view events as they happen by the APIC notifying our client side script.

This is in contrast to polling mechanisms that exist such as writing a script to check for a change every N seconds or minutes. Using the websocket functionality, we'll continuously receive updates directly from APIC as they happen.  The nice thing is, you can selectively subscribe to the events that are important to you.

#### Opening a Websocket Session
The Toolkit abstracts some of the steps in establishing a websocket connection, making it easier to get started. In order to open a websocket in Toolkit, you just need to establish a Session and create a Subscription; the opening of a websocket, and entering subscription URLs are handled by the acitoolkit library.

Open a Python interpreter and follow along:
```bash
$ python
>>>
```

Import the acitoolkit library and login
```python
>>> from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *
>>> 
>>> URL = "https://apic"
>>> LOGIN = "admin"
>>> PASSWORD = "password"
>>> 
>>> session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
>>> session.login()
<Response [200]>
>>> 
```

#### MO Subscriptions
Subscribing to a Managed Object is done by creating an acitoolkit object representing the MO, and then using the `object.subscribe(session)` function.

Subscribe to the "common" Tenant:
```python
>>> tenant = Tenant("common")
>>> tenant.subscribe(session)
True
>>> 
```

#### Class Subscriptions
Subscribing to a Class URL is done by calling the Class.subcribe() function on the session object `Class.subscribe(session)`.

Subscribe to the Tenant class:
```python
>>> Tenant.subscribe(session)
True
>>>  
```

#### Viewing Websocket Events
The Toolkit uses the `Class.has_events(session)` function to check if there are any events in the queue, and the `Class.get_event(session)` to retrieve the first event in the queue.

Check for events and view the first event:
```python
>>> Tenant.has_events(session)
True
>>> event = Tenant.get_event(session)
>>> print(event)
common
>>> print(event.dn)
uni/tn-common
>>> event.is_deleted()
False
```

#### Automating Event Notifications
It would be better if we could automatically check for events and print them to the screen when new events are pushed from the APIC. With Python, we can do this with an infinite "while loop" and use a truthiness test for the `has_events()` function. In python "while True:" will always be true, and can be used to create an infinite loop. Inside the loop we check for an event, and then use the `is_deleted()` function to test whether the object is deleted, or created/modified.

Now create an infinite loop checking for events for the Class Subscription:
```python
>>> while True:
...     if Tenant.has_events(session):
...         event = Tenant.get_event(session)
...         if event.is_deleted():
...             status = "has been deleted"
...         else:
...             status = "has been created/modified"
...         print("\n{} {}".format(event.dn, status))
...

```

Now that you are listening to an event feed, go into the APIC GUI and create a new Tenant named "WS_Example" by:

1.  Click on Tenants tab
2.  Click on "ADD Tenant"
3.  Enter "WS_Example" for the Name
4.  Click Submit

![GUI Add Tenant](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_add_tenant.png)

Look back at your Python Interpreter window and you will see a new message.
```bash
...


uni/tn-WS_Example has been created/modified

```

Now create an Application under Tenant WS_Example called "Example_App"

1.  Right-click on Application Profiles and choose "Create Application Profile"

![GUI Add App1](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_add_app1.png)

2.  Enter "Example_App" for the Name
3.  Click Submit

![GUI Add App2](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_add_app2.png)

Your event feed will still look the same since we are only checking for events in the Tenant class.
```python

uni/tn-WS_Example has been created/modified

```

#### Subscribing to Multiple Classes
We have created a script that subscribes to both Tenant and Application classes; download the script `acitoolkit_websocket.py` from the sample code repo, or copy this to a file named "acitoolkit_websocket.py"
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *

def main():
    URL = "https://apic"
    LOGIN = "admin"
    PASSWORD = "password"
    
    session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
    session.login()
    
    subscribe_to_events()
    
    
def subscribe_to_events():
    Tenant.subscribe(session)
    AppProfile.subscribe(session)
    
    while True:
        if Tenant.has_events(session):
            event = Tenant.get_event(session)
    
            if event.is_deleted():
                status = "has been deleted"
            else:
                status = "has been created/modified"
    
            print("\n{} {}".format(event.dn, status))
    
        elif AppProfile.has_events(session):
            event = AppProfile.get_event(session)
    
            if event.is_deleted():
                status = "has been deleted"
            else:
                status = "has been created/modified"
    
            print("\n{} {}".format(event.dn, status))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

Execute the script
```bash
$ python aci_websocket.py

```

Your event feed is now subscribed to Tenant and Application level events.

First delete the Application you just created, "Example_App"

1.  Right-click on Application "Example_App" and choose Delete
2.  Click YES

![GUI Delete App](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_delete_app.png)

Look back at the terminal window and you will see a new notification for App deletion.
```bash
$ python aci_websocket.py

uni/tn-WS_Example/ap-Example_App has been deleted

```

Now delete the Tenant, "WS_Example"

1.  Right-click on Tenant "WS_Example" and choose Delete
2.  Click YES

![GUI Delete Tenant](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_delete_tenant.png)

Look back at the terminal and you will now see a message for the Tenant deletion.
```bash
$ python aci_websocket.py

uni/tn-WS_Example/Example_App has been deleted

uni.tn-WS_Example has been deleted

```

This lab has introduced the topic of websockets, and how they can be used to subscribe to events in the ACI fabric. We also demonstrated how ACI Toolkit simplifies this process, and how to leverage Python to automatically send notifications when they are recieved. This functionality can be used with a web framework to create an event dashboard that is used to monitor and classify important events.
