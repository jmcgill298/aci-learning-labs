#### Subscription Refresh
Each subscription has a timeout period of 1 minute, but can be refreshed using the subscription ID before the session expires. The URL to refresh a subscription is shown here:
```
HTTP Method: GET
URL: https://apic/api/subscriptionRefresh.json?id=subscriptionID
```

Example refreshing the previous subscription:
```
Method: GET
URL: https://apic/api/subscriptionRefresh.json?id=72057619824574469
```

Go back to Postman and refresh your subscription

If you got response data back from the APIC (example below), then your subscription timed out before you refreshed it.

When you do get a timeout, you only need to re-subscribe to the event feed to start recieving messages again (i.e. you don't need to open up another websocket).

The Simple Web Socket Client is a good way to start using websockets, but it is not very practical for extended use. The rest of this lab shows you how to use websockets with the ACI Toolkit library.
