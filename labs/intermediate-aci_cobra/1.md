# Add "Bite" to your ACI Python Scripts with Cobra

### Introduction to Cobra
"ACI Programmability Options" introduced the Cobra SDK and provided installation instructions. In summary, Cobra is a fully functional Python library used for programming the ACI fabric. We demonstrated how to auto-generate Python scripts in "Creating ACI Scripts the Easy Way."

So far, whether using ACIToolkit, WebArya, or making API calls with Postman, all of exercises have had you build new configurations by manually editing lines of code and sending them to the APIC. If you wanted to make a similar change in the future, then you would have to remember what lines needed updating, and repeat the same steps. This method is tedious, prone to mistakes, and provides only minimal checks before making changes.

In this lab, we will expand ACI's programmability features by making a reusable script with Python/Cobra. This script will provide a help menu to list out the acceptable arguments, and will provide a basic check before commiting configuration changes. Let's first take a brief look at Cobra's **mit** and **model** packages.
