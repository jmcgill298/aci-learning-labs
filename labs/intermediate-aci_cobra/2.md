### Using ACI MIT Packages
The acicobra package contains the classes used to login, query, and submit configurations to the ACI fabric. We will walk you through using the login and query classes to get familiar with using the the acicobra package. Submitting Configurations will be covered with the acimodel package.

#### Establishing a Session
The first step of any script will be to login, which requires the **session** and **access** modules.

Open a Python interpreter and follow this code block to establish a session with the APIC:
```python
$ python
>>> 
# import classes
>>> import cobra.mit.session
>>> import cobra.mit.access
>>> 
# establish a session with the APIC
>>> auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession('https://apic', 'admin', 'password')
>>> session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
>>> session.login()
SSL Warning
>>> 
```

Keep this window open, and we will use this session to make querries with the APIC. If you get an error later that your session has expired, just re-enter `session.login()`

#### Making Queries
"Peeling Back the ACI API" introduced using the API to query the MIT using both DN and Class level queries; Cobra provides this same functionality using the DnQuery and ClassQuery classes. The Query will return a list of all matching objects. Each match will have a set of properties that the particular class supports, and these properties can be accessed using **.property**

Follow along with this code snippet in the Python Interpreter window you just used to create a session with the APIC:

##### Make a DN Query for Tenant Heroes
```python
>>> 
>>> import cobra.mit.request
>>> 
>>> tenant_query = cobra.mit.request.DnQuery("uni/tn-Heroes")
>>> heroes_tenant = session.query(tenant_query)
SSL Warning
>>> heroes_tenant
[<cobra.modelimpl.fv.tenant.Tenant object at 0x7ff60b5bb2d0>]
>>>
```

##### View Available Properties for the Heroes Tenant Object
```python
>>> heroes = heroes_tenant[0]
>>> 
>>> dir(heroes)
['_BaseMo__children', '_BaseMo__dirtyProps', '_BaseMo__dn', '_BaseMo__meta', '_BaseMo__modifyChild', 
'_BaseMo__parentDn', '_BaseMo__parentDnStr', '_BaseMo__parentMo', '_BaseMo__rn', '_BaseMo__setModified', 
'_BaseMo__setprop', '_BaseMo__status', '_ChildContainer', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', 
'__doc__', '__format__', '__getattr__', '__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__module__', 
'__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', 
'__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '_attachChild', '_children', '_delete', '_detachChild', '_dirtyProps', 
'_dn', '_isPropDirty', '_numChildren', '_parent', '_parentDn', '_resetProps', '_rn', '_setParent', '_status', 
'childAction', 'children', 'clone', 'contextRoot', 'delete', 'descr', 'dirtyProps', 'dn', 
'isInstance', 'isPropDirty', 'lcOwn', 'meta', 'modTs', 'monPolDn', 'name', 'numChildren', 'ownerKey', 
'ownerTag', 'parent', 'parentDn', 'prop', 'resetProps', 'rn', 'status', 'uid', 'update']
>>> 
```

##### Viewing Object Properties
```python
>>> heroes.name
'Heroes'
>>> 
>>> heroes.dn
<cobra.mit.naming.Dn object at 0x7ff60c09a910>
>>>
>>> print(heroes.dn)
uni/tn-Heroes
>>> 
>>> str(heroes.dn)
'uni/tn-Heroes'
>>> 
```

#### Scoping Queries
The request class also supports scoping queries to filter results, and to include certain parts of the MIT. These scoping properties will correlate to one of the API methods discussed in "Peeling Back the ACI API."

These are some of the scoping options:

*  propFilter (query-target-filter) filters the results based on class attributes
*  queryTarget (query-target) specifies what part of the MIT to query
    -  self
    -  children
    -  subtree
*  classFilter (target-subtree-class) can be used when `queryTarget` is set to either "children" or "subtree" to filter the returned children to only objects of a specific class or classes.
*  subtree (rsp-subtree) specifies how much of the subtree to retrieve
    -  no
    -  children
    -  full
*  subtreeClassFilter (rsp-subtree-class) filters what subtree classes to include in the response
*  subtreeInclude (rsp-subtree-include) specifies what type of information to include in the subtree
    -  audit-logs
    -  event-logs
    -  faults
    -  health
    -  etc

The next few code blocks will demonstrate using a class query and how scoping affects what results are returned. First we will look at all applications configured on the APIC. Follow along in your own Python Interpreter.

##### Make a Class Query for All App Profiles
```python
>>> app_query = cobra.mit.request.ClassQuery('fvAp')
>>> 
>>> apps = session.query(app_query)
>>> apps
[<cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3c87b6d0>, <cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3c872a50>, 
<cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3c872b90>]
>>> for app in apps:
...     print app.name
... 
default
access
Save_The_Planet
>>>
```

##### Scope the Query to Applications Named "Save_The_Planet"
```python
# set the property filter to only return the app named "Save_The_Planet"
>>> app_query.propFilter = 'eq(fvAp.name, "Save_The_Planet")'
>>> save_the_planet_app = session.query(stp_app)
>>> save_the_planet_app
[<cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3cdee310>]
>>> save_the_planet_app[0].name
Save_The_Planet
>>> 
# save_the_planet_app did not return any child objects for the application
>>> save_the_planet_app[0].numChildren
0
>>> 
```

##### Have the Query Return Child Objects
We saw that our current query has only returned the object itself, and not any of its child objects. This section walks you through how to use a couple of more scoping properties to return "Save_The_Planet's" child objects.
```python
# set the scope to subtree full
>>> app_query.subtree = "full"
>>> 
# demonstrate a typo; cobra provides the acceptable options
>>> app_query.queryTarget = "subtre"
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    (value, str(allowedValues)))
ValueError: "subtre" is invalid, valid values are "set(['self', 'subtree', 'children'])"
>>>
# scope the query to subtree
>>> app_query.queryTarget = "subtree"
>>> 
# look at the applied query scopes using .options
>>> app_query.options
'rsp-subtree=full&query-target-filter=eq(fvAp.name, "Save_The_Planet")&query-target=subtree'
>>> save_the_planet_app_subtree = session.query(app_query)
>>> 
```

##### View the Child Objects for the Query
```python
>>> save_the_planet_app_subtree
[<cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3c735150>]
>>> save_the_planet_app_subtree[0].numChildren
3
>>> for epg in in save_the_planet_app_subtree[0].children:
...     print epg.dn
... 
uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet/epg-web
uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet/epg-app
uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet/epg-db
>>> 
```

This exercise walked you through using queries in a python interpreter, but it is also a good idea to build scripts with them to quickly look for potential issues. A couple of examples would be creating a script that returned an IPs Tenant, Application, and EPG, or finding an IP's physical port and returning the interface counters. We will use it in the next section when we want to compare a new configuration request with what already exists on the fabric.
