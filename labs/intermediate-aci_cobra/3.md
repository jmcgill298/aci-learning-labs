### Using the ACI Model Package
The model package is used to stage configurations, which can either be commited with the acicobra package, or discarded. In order to stage configurations, you will need to know the MIT structure, and the modules and classes required for all MOs from root to the new object. 

##### Staging Configurations
We will create a new EPG under the "Save_The_Planet" Application as an example of how to stage a configuration.

To build the MIT, it is easiest to start at the new object, and then work back to the root. In this example, our new object is of type EPG. EPGs are children of App Profiles ("Save_The_Planet"). The next class closer to root is Tenant ("Heroes"), which is directly under root('uni').

Now that we know what classes are required to build a new tenant, we can identify what modules are required to represent these objects. It turns out that Tenant, App Profile, and EPG classes are all under **cobra.model.fv**, and their class names are **Tenant**, **Ap**, and **AEPg**. We can start at the root of the MIT, **cobra.model.pol.Uni**, and build each child object from its parent.

Open a python interpreter and follow these steps to stage the new EPG:
```python
# import classes
>>> import cobra.mit.session
>>> import cobra.mit.access
>>> import cobra.mit.request
>>> import cobra.model.pol
>>> import cobra.model.fv
>>> 
# establish a session with the APIC
>>> auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession('https://apic', 'admin', 'password')
>>> session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
>>> session.login()
>>> 
# build from root to the new epg
>>> root = cobra.model.pol.Uni('')
>>> tenant = cobra.model.fv.Tenant(root, "Heroes")
>>> app_profile = cobra.model.fv.Ap(tenant, "Save_The_Planet")
>>> epg = cobra.model.fv.AEPg(app_profile, "New_EPG")
>>> 
```

##### Submitting Configurations
The above example has only created the new EPG under the "Save_The_Planet" Application locally; it has not actually created any objects that are represented on the ACI fabric. To submit these requests, the acicobra package needs to be used again.
>When adding an object to the configuration request, the best practice is to add the new object closest to root to the configuration request. This example adds the "epg" object since it is the only new MO. If we had created a new applcation and epg instead, then only the application object would be added to the configuration request.


Use these steps to commit the new EPG to the APIC:
```python
# submit staged configuration to APIC
>>> config_request = cobra.mit.request.ConfigRequest()
>>> config_request.addMo(epg)
>>> session.commit(config_request)
SSL Warning
<Response [200]>
>>> 
```

The new EPG shows up now in the GUI

#### Using Scripts to Make Configuration Changes
Up to this point, we have used Cobra very similarly to making API requests with Postman, but now we show some of the key benefits of using Cobra over tools like Postman. 

*  Unlike Postman, creating scripts with Cobra does not require searching through configuration files and replacing key config details; it is more easily reusable. This reusability makes Cobra less error-prone than editing previously used JSON or XML.
*  Python can be leveraged to create help menus, making it easier for others to use.
*  Tests can be built into the script so that faulty configurations are discarded before any changes are made. Custom error messages can be generated.
*  Python can manipulate user input to format the names to an accepted standard (all caps, no caps, camelcase, hyphens, underscores, etc.)

Here is a table summarizing these differences:

|        | Postman  | Cobra |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| **Reusability** | Requires Editing, Error Prone | Easily Reusable |
| **Help Menu** | None | Can be Built In |
| **Error Checking** | None | Customized for Your Environment |
| **Format Corrections** | None | Customized for Your Environment |

We provide a sample script and discuss how it incorporates some of these features. Afterwards, we have you execute the script and see how it behaves.

>Our script uses python's argparse library to handle function arguments and a help menu. More information about argparse can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html

>The error test function is in the same file as the script; this is normally in its own python file with other tests. This is a basic check meant only to demonstrate how tests can be used to enhance your scripts.

The script we provide is used to configure a new Tenant on the fabric. For our environment, we want all new Tenants to also have their own VRF, Bridge Domain, and Subnet as soon as they are created. In order to enforce this policy, we mark these arguments as required in argparse.

We also want to check if the Tenant name is already in use before we configure it. If the name is a duplicate, then we will discard the changes and notify the user. We will use Cobra's query method to validate only the Tenant, since a unique Tenant will ensure that all child objects are unique objects.

Copy this code into a text editor and save it as **create_tenant.py**; it is also available in the sample code repo as cobra_tenant.py.

Now use this file to create a new tenant named "Example" only passing the **-t** argument.
```bash
$ python create_tenant.py -t Example
usage: Creates a Tenant in the specified ACI fabric.
Create Tenant: error: argument -v/--vrf is required
$ 
```

The script failed to execute since we require a VRF, Bridge Domain, and Subnet to be included with Tenant creation.

Now use the **-h** argument to view the help menu.
```bash
$ python create_tenant.py -h
usage: Creates a Tenant in the specified ACI fabric.

Required: Tenant, VRF, Bridge Domain, Subnet

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TENANT, --tenant TENANT
                        The New Tenant's Name.
  -v VRF, --vrf VRF     The Tenant's VRF.
  -b BD, --bd BD        The Tenant's Bridge Domain.
  -g GW, --gw GW        The Bridge Domain's Gateway using CIDR.
  -s SCOPE, --scope SCOPE
                        The Subnet's Scope is 'private' or 'public'.
  -sn SUBNETNAME, --subnetname SUBNETNAME
                        The Subnet's name.
$ 
```

Now pass all of the required arguments to build the Example Tenant correctly.
```bash
$ python create_tenant.py -t Example -v Example_VRF -b Example_BD -g 10.10.10.1/24 -s public

New Tenant, Example, has been created:

{"fvTenant": {"attributes": {"status": "created,modified", "name": "Example"}, "children": [{"fvBD": {"attributes": {"status": "created,modified", "name": "Example_BD"}, "children": [{"fvSubnet": {"attributes": {"status": "created,modified", "ip": "10.10.10.1/24", "scope": "public"}}}, {"fvRsCtx": {"attributes": {"status": "created,modified", "tnFvCtxName": "Example_VRF"}}}]}}, {"fvCtx": {"attributes": {"status": "created,modified", "name": "Example_VRF"}}}]}}

$ 
```

Repeat the last step
```bash
$ python create_tenant.py -t Example -v Example_VRF, -b Example_BD, -g 10.10.1/24 -s public

Tenant Example has already been created on the APIC

This lab has demonstrated the advantages of using Cobra and creating scripts that can easily be reused, and that offer the security of validating configurations before being implemented. Since Cobra is a 1-to-1 mapping, you can use it to automate troubleshooting and configuration tasks, and you can use Python to make sure the objects are configured in a consistent manner.
