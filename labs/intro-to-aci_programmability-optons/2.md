### ACI Programmability
ACI was built with programmability in mind, and designed to be configured and maintained through a central controller via a REST API. This API is how admins interact with the object-model, which allows them to make changes, gather stats, and troubleshoot the ACI fabric.

The Rest API uses HTTP and supports all four CRUD methods:

*  Create new objects
*  Read objects to view confguration and statistical data
*  Update existing objects
*  Delete objects that are no longer needed

We will use Postman to see how these methods are used by the API, and provide further discussion about using the API in "ACI API." Follow along with these instructions, and use that lab to learn more about using the API.

Postman uses Chrome, so you need to login to the APIC GUI if it is using a self-signed certificate. Go ahead and open a browser to the APIC and browse to "Tenants."

Now open Postman and login to the APIC:
```json
Method: POST
URL: https://apic/api/aaaLogin.json
Body:
{
    "aaaUser": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "admin",
            "pwd": "password"
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure that it returns "200 OK"

##### Create
Now that you have a connection with the APIC, make a request to create a Tenant named "New_Tenant"
```json
Method: POST
URL: https://apic/api/mo/uni.json
Body:
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "New_Tenant"
        }
    }
}
```

The URL is derived from the MIT. Since Tenant objects are under the root, the DN path is "uni"

![Postman Add Tenant](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_programmability-optons/assets/images/postman_add_tenant.png)

##### Read
Reading capabilities use an HTTP GET request; use this to view the Tenant you just created:
```
Method: GET
URL: https://apic/api/mo/uni/tn-New_Tenant.json?
```

This URL adds the RN "tn-New_Tenant" to create the full DN of the Tenant: `uni/tn-New_Tenant`. This full DN is required to view a specific Managed Object. Since this is using GET, the request does not include a body.

![Postman Get Tenant](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_programmability-optons/assets/images/postman_get_tenant.png)

The APIC responded back with the Tenant properties; notice that the "descr" property is currently empty.

##### Update
Now add a description to the tenant to demonstrate the update capabilities:
```json
Method: POST
URL: https://apic/api/mo/uni/tn-New_Tenant.json
BODY:
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "New_Tenant",
            "descr": "Modify Tenant",
            "status": "modified"
        }
    }
}
```

The body of this request adds a "descr" attribute to add a description to the Tenant. The "status" attribute is also included to inform the APIC that this request is for updating an existing object.

![Postman Update Tenant](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_programmability-optons/assets/images/postman_update_tenant.png)

Look back at the APIC GUI, and the "New_Tenant" now has a description.

![APIC Tenants Update](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_programmability-optons/assets/images/apic_tenants_update.png)

##### Delete
You can Delete the Tenant using a DELETE request:
```
Method: DELETE
URL: https://apic/api/mo/uni/tn-New_Tenant.json
```

The body is not needed with the DELETE request, as the APIC will Delete the object specified by the DN in the URL.

![Postman Delete Tenant](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_programmability-optons/assets/images/postman_delete_tenant.png)

We used Postman to perform all CRUD methods against the REST API. This same REST API is actually used by all interfaces that communicate with the APIC, including:

*  GUI
*  CLI
*  ACI Toolkit
*  Cobra SDK

#### ACI Toolkit
Many people begin using the REST API with a tool like Postman, which is an easy way to get familiar and make test API calls. ACI offers another tool, ACI Toolkit, that makes it easy to start interacting with the APIC programmitically. ACI Toolkit is set of Python libraries that are built to interact with a subset of the more commonly used objects in the MIT. It also comes with a collection of ready made python apps built to accomplish specific tasks.

The ACI Toolkit can be used to create, read, update, and delete most of the objects inside of the Tenant Class, and also works with the Fabric Access Policies (layer 2 encaps, physical ports, port-channels/vpc, etc.).

Here is an example of using the Toolkit to create a new Tenant:
```python
>>> from acitoolkit import acitoolkit
>>> 
# login credentials
>>> url = "https://apic"
>>> login = "admin"
>>> password = "password"
>>> 
# connect to the apic
>>> session = acitoolkit.Session(url, login, password)
>>> session.login()
<Response [200]>
>>> 
# create a new tenant
>>> new_tenant = acitoolkit.Tenant("New_Tenant")
>>> 
# commit the new configuration
>>> config_request = session.push_to_apic(new_tenant.get_url(), new_tenant.get_json())
<Response [200]>
>>> 
```

This is a simple example, but the ACI Toolkit can be used to create scripts that build a new application with multiple EPGs, assign the EPGs to the proper Bridge Domain, have them provide and consume contracts, and connect them to physical and virtual infrastructure. It also has some ready-made applications that provide visualizations and store persistent data, such as end point locations and fabric configurations. We will dive deeper into the Toolkit's capabilities in the following labs.

While ACI Toolkit is a great way to program against a fabric, it was built to only perform the most common of operations on a fabric. There is another Python library called Cobra that is a fully functional, 1:1 mapping of the MIT. 

#### Cobra SDK
Cobra is a Python SDK that supports CRUD operations of an ACI fabric. Since this is a complete mapping of the object-model, it will be more complex than the ACI Toolkit Library and is usually used by more software developers as compared to network engineers using ACI Toolkit.

A complete mapping of the object-model means:

*  The complete MIT is incorporated into the Cobra SDK
*  All operations accessible through the API can also be achieved via Cobra
*  The SDK is modeled after the MIT, so the Python class and property names will match what is in the MIT
  -  The Cobra module will be the letters up to the first capital letter
  -  The Cobra class will be the rest of the ID
  -  Examples:
    +  fvTenant: Module = fv, Class = Tenant
    +  l3extOut: Module = l3ext, Class = Out
  -  Properties can be accessed by calling ".property" on the object
  -  Examples:
    +  tenant.name
    +  endpoint.ip

Since Cobra offers full functionality, it is better suited for doing more complex queries with filters, incorporating L4-L7 device packages for network service devices external to ACI, and for creating initial fabric build scripts that configure less common tasks like snmp, syslog, spine BGP policy, etc.

The Cobra libraries are dowloaded directly from the APIC:

1.  Browse to https://apic_address/cobra/_downloads/
2.  Dowload both .egg files
  *  acicobra-version.egg
  *  acimodel-version.egg

Once the packages have been downloaded, you can use **easy_install** to install them. 

> Note: The acicobra package should be installed before the acimodel.

```bash
$ easy_install -Z directory/path/acicobra-version.egg
$ easy_install -Z dierctory/path/acimodel-version.egg
$ 
```

More information can be found at http://cobra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html. Once both packages have been successfully installed, the Cobra libraries are ready to be imported and used like any other Python library.

This is an example of how to use Cobra to create a Tenant:
```python
>>> import cobra.mit.access
>>> import cobra.mit.request
>>> import cobra.mit.session
>>> import cobra.model.fv
>>> import cobra.model.pol
>>> 
# login credentials
>>> url = "https://apic"
>>> login = "admin"
>>> password = "password"
>>> 
# connect to the apic
>>> auth = cobr.mit.session.LoginSession(url, login, password)
>>> session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
>>> session.login()
SSL Warning
>>> 
# create a new tenant
>>> root = cobra.model.pol.Uni('')
>>> new_tenant = cobra.model.fv.Tenant(root, "New_Tenant")
>>> 
# commit the new configuration
>>> config_request = cobra.mit.request.ConfigRequest()
>>> config_request.addMo(new_tenant)
>>> session.commit(config_request)
SSL Warning
<Response [200]>
>>> 
```

We can immediately see that Toolkit abstracts some of the intricacies  involved with using Cobra; however, Cobra also has tools that make it more accessible.
