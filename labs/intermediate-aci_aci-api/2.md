### Visore
Visore is an object-browser built into the APIC. It can be reached by navigating to https://apic/visore.html. 

Go ahead and open your browser to Visore and use the APICs credentials to login.

#### Search by DN
Visore can query an object either by Class or by DN. The interface is intelligent enough to determine which method you are using, so there is no need to select the method. First, you will make a DN query for the `app` EPG under the `Save_The_Planet` Application Profile. Looking back at the the previous JSON struture, you can see the the RN is "epg-app." `fvAEPg` objects are children of the `fvAP` class, and this particular `fvAP` object is `ap-Save_The_Planet`. We still haven't made it to root yet, so the next parent object is a `fvTenant` object. This Application's Tenant has a "dn" of `uni/tn-Heroes`. Since `uni` is the root, we can append all of the proper RNs to build the DN: `uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet/epg-app`. Search for that in your Visore browser.

#### Search by Class
Now browse by Class for fvTenant.

![Visore Class](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/visore_class.png)

Notice this returns all objects of type `fvTenant`, thus returns all 4 tenants configured in the APIC.

Click the "Display URI of last query" link to see the URI used to retrieve the Tenant objects. We will discuss the URI more when we start making the API requests, but this will be very useful. This query returned all Managed Objects of the class fvTenant, however browsing by class also allows for the query to be filtered based on attributes. 

Now run the same query with a filter: `Property: name, Op: ==, Val1: Heroes`.

![Visore Tenant Class Filtered](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/visore_class_filtered.png)

This returned only the "Heroes" Tenant, and the URI is now double the original path. Take note of the new API call by clicking the Display URI link.

#### Query Filters
The ACI API has robust filtering options, and allows for up to 20 different expressions per query. Here are a few of the query filter expressions:

| Operator | Description |
| ---------|:-----------:|
| eq    | Equal to |
| ne    | Not equal to |
| lt    | Less than |
| gt    | Greater than |
| le    | Less than or equal to |
| ge    | Greater than or equal to |
| not   | Logical inverse |
| and   | Logical AND |
| or    | Logical OR |
| wcard | Wildcard |


Now open Postman and try a few of these to see how it works.

In order to connect with the APIC you will need to use POST with the authentication parameters:

```json
HTTP Method: POST
URL: `https://apic/api/aaaLogin.json`
Body:
{
    "aaaUser": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "admin",
            "pwd": "password"
        }
    }
}
```

You should see a 200 OK response in Postman. If you do not, check that the URL, Username, and Password are correct.

![Postman Login](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_login.png)

First you will do a GET request using the URI from the filtered fvTenant query.

The URL provided below has removed the `and` after `query-target-filter`. This "and" is used as a "Logical AND" which checks that two or more conditions are met; this query only has 1 filter, so it is not required. Also, `.xml` has been changed to `.json`, but either option would work. Do a GET request with this URL: `https://apic/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes")`

Using Postman, peform the following request:
```
HTTP Method: GET
URL: `https://apic/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes")`
```

![Postman Get Tenant Heroes](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_get_tenant_heroes.png)

With the JSON formatted response you can see that the dictionary key/value pairs correspond exactly to the attributes shown in Visore. This filter did a comparison to the "name" attribute.

Perform another Postman request using the "dn" attribute in addition to the "name" attriubute. The syntax for filtering is `class.attribute,"value"`. You will need to add the "and" keyword back this time since we are comparing two values.  Update the URL in Postman to the following:

```
https://apic/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=and(eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes"),eq(fvTenant.dn,"uni/tn-Heroes"))
```

Execute the request, and the APIC will return the same results.

Now change the "dn" to "uni/tn-Heros" and re-run the request. This time the APIC will accept this as a valid request (the APIC responds with a "200 OK"), but it returns zero results.

![Postman Get Tenant Failed](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_get_tenant_failed.png)

The reason this failed is that the "Logical AND" operator was used, and no Tenant object met both conditions. Go ahead and use the following URL that uses **or** instead: 

```
https://apic/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=or(eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes"),eq(fvTenant.dn,"uni/tn-Heros"))
```

Execute another request in Postman with this new URL.

You should see the Heroes Tenant again since "Logical OR" tests only that at least one of the conditions is met.

These examples are all testing for equality, but you can also test for inequality. A network admin might want to see what Tenants exist on the Fabric besides the default Tenants of "common", "infra", and "mgmt." 

In order to show this, put the following URL in Postman and see what Tenants have been configured:

```
https://apic/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=and(ne(fvTenant.name,"common"),ne(fvTenant.name,"infra"),ne(fvTenant.name,"mgmt"))
```


This example uses the "and" and "ne" opperators to filter out the undesired results.

#### Query Scopes
Take another look back at Visore; you should still have the "fvTenant" search opened. If you look at the "dn" value in the Heroes Tenant, you should see a couple of green arrows.

![Visore Tenant Class Filtered Arrow](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/visore_class_filtered_arrow.png)

The left arrow jumps back one class closer to root, and the right arrow jumps into all objects of the Heroes Tenant's children. Click the right arrow.

![Visore Right Arrow](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/visore_right_arrow.png)

If you look at all of the peach colored headings, you should notice that they list out the different classes under Tenant, and this looks identical to the JSON that was built out at the beginning of this lab. This means that you can browse through objects in Visore and see how they are related, what attributes they have, and how to construct JSON or XML files for configurations(clicking "Display last response" actually provides the XML values).

Clicking the arrow on the DN also changed our query from searching by class to searching by DN. The URI tips us off to this by changing the third section from **class** to **mo**. We usually think searching by DN as returning only one result since a DN is unique, however this URI uses **Scoping Filters** to expand the query to its chidlren. This is the same method used when downloading configurations from the GUI and setting the content and scope. Here are a few options:

*  **query-target**={self|children|subtree}
    -  self is the MO itself
    -  children is just the MO's child objects
    -  subtree contains the MO and its child objects
*   **target-subtree-class**=[list of 1 or more sub-classess of the MO]
    -   only returns child objects of the specified classes
*   **rsp-subtree**={no|children|full}
    -   no is the default and the response does not include any children
    -   children will return only the child objects
    -   full includes the full tree structure
*   **query-target-filter**=filter expression (this was reviewed above)
*   **rsp-prop-include**={all|naming-only|config-only}
    -   all returns all properties of the objects
    -   naming-only returns only the naming properties
    -   config-only returns only properties that are configurable

In addition to using many filter expressions in the same request, you can also combine several scoping filters by using the "&" symbol.

Navigate back to Postman and query for the class fvTenant with a name equal to "Heroes"; obtain the full branch, but only configuration values. 

Use this URL:

```
https://apic/api/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes")&rsp-subtree=full&rsp-prop-include=config-only
```

Visore is great for browsing through the MIT and for obtaining query URIs, but it requires some assembly to do either POST or DELETE requests. There is another tool, the API Inspector, that will help us construct full POST or Delete requests and still aid in showing GET request URLs too.
