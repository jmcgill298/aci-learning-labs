### API Inspector

The API Inspector is built into the APIC and is used to capture API requests being made to the controller. Remember that the APIC GUI is itself an API client and makes API requests to the underlying APIC controllers.   The API Inspector allows you to _sniff_ these requests to see which API calls are being made.  

Let's get started and learn how to use the API Inspector.

Ensure you are logged into the APIC controllers.

In the APIC GUI, click on the "Welcome" dropdown and choose **Show API Inspector**.

![Launch API Inspector](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/launch_api_inspector.png)

This launches a new window that will list the API requests as they are made. Uncheck **Scroll to latest** so the logs do not auto-scroll. 

![API Inspector Open](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/api_inspector_open.png)

Click around in the GUI a few times; you'll start seeing some GET requests appear in the Inspector window. 

Now click on the Tenants tab.  You'll see the following in the Inspector window as soon you as you click it:

```
method: GET
url: https://apic/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=or(eq(...
response: {"totalCount": ...
```

These are going to look similar to the URIs and responses that we saw in Visore, and used in Postman. 

Now Create a new Tenant in the GUI by:

1.  Click on **Add Tenant**
2.  Name the Tenant "Villains"
3.  Name the VRF "Villains_Only"
4.  Click **Submit**

![GUI Add Villains](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_add_villains.png)

You'll see a POST request in the API Inspector window. You can also search for "post" in the API Inspector search bar.

```
method: POST
url: https://apic/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Villains.json
payload{"fvTenant":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains","name":"Villains","rn":"tn-Villains","status":"created"},"children":[{"fvCtx":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains/ctx-Villains_Only","name":"Villains_Only","rn":"ctx-Villains_Only","status":"created"},"children":[]}}]}}
response: {"totalCount":"0","imdata":[]}
```

The information displayed in the Inspector window is needed for the next task; specfically the URL and Payload.  We will use the URL and Payload to create this Tenant using Postman.

Copy this information to a text editor. 

#### API URL

We have already had you do a few GET requests, but we haven't really talked about the URL. The first portion is always the same: protocol, apic address, and operator ("api"). It will look something like `https://apic/api` or sometimes `https://apic/api/node`.

The next two sections of the URL depends on if the API call is a Class-based or DN-based API call, just as you learned when using Visore.

If the API call is a Class-based query, you use `/class/<class-name>`.

If the API call is a DN-based query, you use `/mo/<dn>`.

> Note: POST requests will always use `/mo/<dn>` since you're effectively making a change to a specific managed object.
 
The last required portion, which is a file extension, dictates the encoding format requested by the API client.

You can choose to use `.xml` or `.json` thus choosing to use XML or JSON data encoding.  

You can optionally add query filters as we showed during the Visore lab.


![API URL](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/api_url.png)

#### API POSTS
With this understanding of the URL, you can look at the request you just copied from API Inspector and see that it uses `/mo/<dn>` since it is using POST; the DN is `uni/tn-Villains`. 

When doing POST requests, it is generally a good practice to choose the payload's "Content-Type"; since the Inspector uses JSON, choose `JSON(application/json)`, and while we show that here, it is NOT used since APIC requires the use of the file extension to dictate the Content-Type and Accept-Type headers.


![Postman Select JSON](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_select_json.png)

Copy the URL and Body into Postman and send the POST request. 

![Postman Config Error](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_config_error.png)

You'll get a "400 Bad Request" response, and the content informs us that the Tenant "Villains" already exists. 

This is not bad, but it does illustrate that ACI will not try creating an object that already exists.

> Note: you can change the `status` flag to "modified" from "created" and a 400 Bad request would not occur and this would highlight the fact that the API when using "modified" is idempotent, meaning you can make the same request N times and it'll only be implemented the first time.

While in the APIC GUI, delete the exisiting "Villains" Tenant.

Make sure you still have API Inspector open (you might want to click clear to get a clean window), and in the GUI:

1.  Right-click on **Tenant Villains**
2.  Choose **Delete**

![GUI Delete Tenant](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_delete_tenant.png)

The API Inspector should show something similar to the Tenant creation request, but the "status" attribute has a value of "deleted".

```
method: POST
url: https://apic/api/node/mo/uni.json
payload{"polUni":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni","status":"modified"},"children":[{"fvTenant":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains","status":"deleted"},"children":[]}}]}}
response: {"totalCount":"0","imdata":[]}
```

Now POST the Villains Tenant configuration again; this time you'll see a "200 OK"

![Postman Config Works](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_config_works.png)

So far we have mostly covered the Application and EPG branches of the Tenant, so let's go to the GUI and see if we can learn how the Contracts and Filters are modeled. With API Inspector still open:

1.  Expand Tenant Villains' **Security Policies** directory
2.  Right-click on **Filters**
3.  Click **Create Filter** to configure a ne Filter MO

![GUI Create Filter](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_create_filter.png)

A new window will pop up that guides you through configuring the filter.

1. Name the Filter "DNS_Query"
2. Click the **+** to configure an entry
3. Name the entry "udp-53"
4. Choose an EtherType of "IP"
5. Choose an IP Protocol of "udp"
6. Set the Destination Ports:
    *  From dns
    *  To dns
7. Click **Update**
8. Click **Submit**

![GUI Configure Filter](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_configure_filter.png)

That will generate a POST message in the Inspector, which you need to copy to a text editor.

```
method: POST
url: https://apic/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Villains/flt-DNS_Query.json
payload{"vzFilter":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains/flt-DNS_Query","name":"DNS_Query","rn":"flt-DNS_Query","status":"created"},"children":[{"vzEntry":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains/flt-DNS_Query/e-udp-53","name":"udp-53","etherT":"ip","prot":"udp","dFromPort":"dns","dToPort":"dns","rn":"e-udp-53","status":"created"},"children":[]}}]}}
response: {"totalCount":"0","imdata":[]}
```

Now do the same thing for creating a contract:

1.  Right-click on the "Contracts" folder
2.  choose **Create Contract**

![GUI Create Contract](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_create_contract.png)

This will bring up a new configuration window:

1.  Name the contract "DNS"
2.  click the **+** to add a Subject.

![GUI Name Contract](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_name_contract.png)

In the **Create Contract Subject** window:

1.  Name the Subject "DNS_Query"
2.  Click the **+** to choose a Filter

![GUI Configure Contract Subj](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_configure_contract_subj.png)

3.  Use the down arrow to expand the list of available Filters
4.  Select the "DNS_Query" object you just created
5.  Click **Update**
6.  Click **OK** to configure the Contract Subject

![GUI Configure Contract Subj](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_configure_contract_subj2.png)

That will bring you back to the **Create Contract** window; click **Submit** to configure the Contract MO. You'll now see a new POST message in API Inspector.

```
method: POST
url: https://apic/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS.json
payload{"vzBrCP":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS","name":"DNS","rn":"brc-DNS","status":"created"},"children":[{"vzSubj":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS/subj-DNS_Query","name":"DNS_Query","rn":"subj-DNS_Query","status":"created"},"children":[{"vzRsSubjFiltAtt":{"attributes":{"status":"created,modified","tnVzFilterName":"DNS_Query"},"children":[]}}]}}]}}
response: {"totalCount":"0","imdata":[]}
```

#### Building a Single POST Request
You could modify both requests to create new objects, and use the URLs to individually POST the configurations, but wouldn't it be nice to make only one request? Taking what you have learned about Classes, MOs, and the MIT structure, you'll now do this. First look at the DNs of both Filter and Contract MOs:

*  "uni/tn-Villains/flt-DNS_Query"
*  "uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS"

Both of these start with `uni/tn-Villains`, so that will be used to create the URL: `https://apic/api/mo/uni/tn-Villains.json`. This also tells us that the beginning of our configuration branch has to be Tenant Villains. Previous Tenant configs can be used formulate this part of the JSON config:
```json
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "Villains"
        },
        "children": []
    }
}
```

Also looking at the DNs, we know that both the Filter and Contract classes are direct children of the Tenant Class, so it'll be as easy as inserting the configuration data obtained from the Inspector into the Tenant's "children" list. Don't forget that each dictionary is a separate item in the list, so they will need to be separated by a commma.
```json
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "Villains"
        },
        "children": [
            {
                "vzFilter": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "dn": "uni/tn-Villains/flt-DNS_Query",
                        "name": "DNS_Query",
                        "rn": "flt-DNS_Query",
                        "status": "created"
                    },
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "vzEntry": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "dn": "uni/tn-Villains/flt-DNS_Query/e-udp-53",
                                    "name": "udp-53",
                                    "etherT": "ip",
                                    "prot": "udp",
                                    "dFromPort": "dns",
                                    "dToPort": "dns",
                                    "rn": "e-udp-53",
                                    "status": "created"
                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                "vzBrCP": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "dn": "uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS",
                        "name": "DNS",
                        "rn": "brc-DNS",
                        "status": "created"
                    },
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "vzSubj": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "dn": "uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS/subj-DNS_Query",
                                    "name": "DNS_Query",
                                    "rn": "subj-DNS_Query",
                                    "status": "created"
                                },
                                "children": [
                                    {
                                        "vzRsSubjFiltAtt": {
                                            "attributes": {
                                                "status": "created,modified",
                                                "tnVzFilterName": "DNS_Query"
                                            },
                                            "children": []
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Instead of deleting the configuration you made in the GUI, add a new Filter for DNS Zone Transfers to the DNS Contract. Here is what needs to be changed in the `vzFilter` (Filter) object

1.  Change the vzFilter "name" to "DNS_ZoneTransfer"
2.  Change the vzEntry "name" to "tcp-53" 
3.  Change the vzEntry "prot" to "tcp"

The `vzBrCP` (Contract) will keep the same name, but will have some other updates:

1.  Change the vzBrCP "status" to "modified" since it has already been "created"
2.  Change the vzSubj "name" to "DNS_ZoneTransfer"
3.  Change the vzRsSubjFiltAtt (the vzFilter being used) "name" to "DNS_ZoneTransfer"

The "dn" and "rn" attributes are not actually required when sending POST requests, so below is a shortened configuration that will work. Also, removing the "dn" and "rn" attributes means there are fewer lines that need changes. If you do not remove these attributes, then they will need to be updated to their new correct values.
```json
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "Villains"
        },
        "children": [
            {
                "vzFilter": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "name": "DNS_ZoneTransfer",
                        "status": "created"
                    },
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "vzEntry": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "name": "tcp-53",
                                    "etherT": "ip",
                                    "prot": "tcp",
                                    "dFromPort": "dns",
                                    "dToPort": "dns",
                                    "status": "created"
                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                "vzBrCP": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "name": "DNS",
                        "status": "modified"
                    },
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "vzSubj": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "name": "DNS_ZoneTransfer",
                                    "status": "created"
                                },
                                "children": [
                                    {
                                        "vzRsSubjFiltAtt": {
                                            "attributes": {
                                                "status": "created,modified",
                                                "tnVzFilterName": "DNS_ZoneTransfer"
                                            },
                                            "children": []
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Deleting Configurations
Now that you understand how to make GET and POST requests using the API, the final step is to Delete an object. The ACI API actually uses the POST request to delete and object. We noticed similariites to to our creation request when we deleted the Villains Tenant; the difference was the "status" attribute was changed to "deleted" though.

This exercise will have you delete the "DNS" contract. If we take just the DNS Contract portion of the above config, we have this:
```json
{
    "vzBrCP": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "DNS",
            "status": "modified"
        }
    }
}
```

Since you know that `vzBrCP` is a child of `fvTenant`, and that this Contract instance belongs to the Villains Tenant, you'll be able to build the URL:
`https://apic/api/mo/uni/tn-Villains`. Change the "status" attribute to "deleted" and POST the request. 

Since the body only contained the Contract Object, the Filters will still exist on the Fabric.

This module has provided more details on Classes and Managed Objects, and demonstrated how understanding them is important to interacting with the API. We have also explored more of the MIT and shown how it maps to the API by making GET and POST requests. Visore and the API Inspector are tools that make navigating and using the API easier.
