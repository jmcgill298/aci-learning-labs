# Peeling back the ACI API

### Overview
The "Intro to ACI Programmability" module introduced the ACI API; this lab will expand on that content by looking at more detail on how to use the API. We will use Visore and the API Inspector to examine the API, and Postman to interact with it.

The ACI API is mapped to the Management Information Model/Tree (MIM and MIT). Remember that everything in ACI is an object.  This means you can think of the MIT as the structure that forms relationships between these objects. So in order to create, delete, manage, or view these objects, you will need to have an understanding of how objects are inter-connected in the MIT.

### Classes and MOs
ACI is designed after object-oriented programming, which means that an object's **Class** will determine its functions and attributes. These objects are referred to as **Managed Objects** or **MOs** for short. The Intro module had you create a MO of the Tenant class named "Cisco_Comics." This class has attributes such as name, description, status, etc. The Tenant class also has several child classes: VRF, Bridge Domain, Application (Profile), etc. Each of 
these classes will have their own attributes, and potentially their own child classes. Each instance of a class is a distinct MO, which will be referenced by its "name" attribute inside the Class. 

So far we have been using more friendly names like "Tenant" and "VRF", however their actual Class names will be a little different. Let's start with the Tenant class and build up an abbrieviated configuration using JSON to identify their real names.
```json
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "descr": "",
            "dn": "uni/tn-Heroes",
            "name": "Heroes",
            "status": ""
        },
        "children": [
            {
                "fvCtx": {}
            },
            {
                "fvBD": {}
            },
            {
                "fvAp": {}
            },
            {
                "l3extOut": {}
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Looking at this shortened JSON configuration, we can observe the following class names used by the MIT:

*  fvTenant = Tenant
*  fvCtx = VRF (this was originally called Context)
*  fvBD = Bridge Domain
*  fvAp = Application
*  l3extOut = Layer 3 External Out (used to form routed connections with devices external to the ACI fabric)

So far there is only one MO defined, which is "Heroes" and belongs to the Tenant class.

Let's build out the same structure with more managed objects.

```json
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "dn": "uni/tn-Heroes",
            "status": ""
        },
        "children": [
            {
                "fvCtx": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "rn": "ctx-Heroes_Only",
                        "status": ""
                        },
                    "children": []
                }
            },
            {
                "fvBD": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "arpFlood": "no",
                        "mac": "00:22:BD:F8:19:FF",
                        "rn": "BD-Hero_Land",
                        "unicastRoute": "yes"
                    }
                    "children" [
                        {
                            "fvRsCtx": {}
                        },
                        {
                            "fvSubnet": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "ip": "10.1.120.1/22",
                                    "rn": "subnet-[10.1.120.1/22]",
                                    "scope": "public"
                                }
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "fvSubnet": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "ip": "192.168.120.1/22",
                                    "rn": "subnet-[192.168.120.1/22]",
                                    "scope": "private"
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                "fvAp": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "rn": "ap-Save_The_Planet"
                    },
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "fvAEPg": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "rn": "epg-app"
                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "fvAEPg": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "rn": "epg-db"
                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "fvAEPg": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "rn": "epg-web"
                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                "l3extOut": {}
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

We now have a few more pieces of the Tenant portion of the MIT. If you look carefully at the structure of the JSON, you should notice a pattern. Each class has a dictionary of attributes, followed by a list of children. Each child is its own class with its own distinctive set of attributes (e.g. Subnet has unique attributes of `ip` and `scope`) and children. The Subnet class is the exception, and has no children since it is the lowest class in the branch. The Classes and MOs are summarized below:


```
Class fvTenant = Tenant and has a MO of "Heroes"
|
+-- Class fvCtx = VRF and has a MO of "Heroes_Only"
|   |
|   +-- child classes
|
+-- Class fvBD = Bridge Domain and has a MO of "Hero_Land"
|   |
|   +-- Class fvSubnet = Subnet and has MO of "10.1.120.1/22 and "192.168.120.1/22"
|
+-- Class fvAp = Application Profile and has a MO of "Save_The_Planet"
|   |
|   +-- ClassfvAEPg = End Point Group and has MOs of "app", "db", and "web"
|       |
|       +-- child classes
|
+-- Class l3extOut = Layer 3 External Out
    |
    +-- child classes
```

Notice also that the "name" attribute has been removed as it's optional key/attribute; the "dn" and "rn" attributes have been used instead. Recall from "ACI Programmability Options" that the Relative Name is the objects name in relation to its class. The Distinguished Name is a universally unique name built by appending an object's RN to its parent's DN. This sounds a bit circular at first, but it works because all DN's are derived from the top-level object, "uni" (similar to how recursive functions work). These names will prove useful when we start to make API requests.

Now that we have a better understanding of Classes and MOs, and how they relate to the MIT, lets look at Visore and make some API requests.
