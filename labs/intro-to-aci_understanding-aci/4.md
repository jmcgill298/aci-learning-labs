### ACI Terminology
It was previously mentioned that the APICs operate using an object-based Policy Engine; this enables the network administrator to define desired states of the fabric, but leave the implementation up to the controller (APIC). As workloads move, the controller re-configures the underlying infrastructure to ensure the necessary policies are still in place for the end hosts. The branch of the object-model these policies are defined under is the **Tenant** object, and this is where most of the day-to-day operations exist.

#### ACI Tenants
![Tenant Network](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/tenant_network.png)

Tenants are a top level object that helps identify and separate administrative control, network/failure domains, and application policies. A Tenant's sub-level objects can be grouped into two basic categories: Tenant Networking and Tenant Policy. These two categories do have inherent relationships, but it can be helpful to discuss them separately. A Tenants Network level objects consist of:

#### Tenant Networking

*  **VRFs**, also named Contexts and Private Networks. This is an isolated routing table for the Tenant. A Tenant can have one or many VRFs, or could use a VRF from a special Tenant named _common_ . Having each Tenant utilize its own VRF allows network isolation, which also helps to limit the network’s failure domain. In the below diagram, the **infra** VRF is in the grey area. All additional VRFs exist on any leaf that a has a host assigned to the VRF.
*  **Bridge Domains** are the Layer 2 forwarding domain within the fabric, and defines the unique MAC address space and flooding domain (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast). Each Bridge Domain is associated with only one VRF, however a VRF can be associated with many Bridge Domains. Unlike how VLANs have been traditionally deployed, each Bridge Domain can contain multiple subnets. Instead of having to create and deploy new Layer 2 networks, new IP spaces can easily and rapidly be deployed within the existing Bridge Domain. Also unlike VLANs, Bridge Domains are automatically deployed to every switch where hosts within the network are connected. There is no longer a need to create new VLANs and extend them across trunk ports.
*  **Subnets** are the Layer 3 networks that provide IP space and gateway services for hosts to connect to the network. Each subnet is associated with only 1 Bridge Domain. Hosts in a given subnet need to be associated with that Bridge Domain, which is discussed further under Tenant Policy.
*  **External Bridged Networks** connect a Layer 2/Spanning-Tree Network to the ACI fabric. This is commonly used in brownfield environments to have a smooth migration from a traditional network infrastracture to an ACI network. The below diagram also has Layer 2 External networks for L4-L7 devices.
*  **External Routed Networks** create a Layer 3 adjacency with a network outside of the ACI fabric. Layer 3 External networks support adjancies using BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP, or using static routes. Layer 3 connections also have networks defined, which provide and consume contracts (discussed more in Tenant Policy).

Before moving onto discussing the Tenant Policy, it is important to briefly discuss some key distinctions from ACI's networking constructs to how network's have traditionally been deployed. 

For many years, it has been the case that each subnet is associated with a particular VLAN. Security, QoS, and L4-L7 policies are determined by what IP Address is assigned to the host, and therefore a host's VLAN configuration.

ACI can be used similarly to the network centric implementation, but a more application centric approach breaks down this coupling of the Layer 2 encapsulation with the Layer 3 domain. In a more application centric configuration, hosts belong to a Bridge Domain, which only defines the Layer 2 flooding and available IP space. The Layer 2 encapsulation (VLAN, VXLAN, NVGRE) determines the security, QoS, and L4-L7 policies, but is completely unrelated to the Bridge Domain.

![Bridge Domain](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/bridge_domain.png)

As an example, Bridge Domain "A" is configured with two subnets. Hosts connected to this Bridge Domain are free to use any available IP address in either subnet. Although there are only two subnets assigned, there might be several VLAN/VXLAN/NVGRE encapsulations associated with these hosts. When the two subnets are used up, all that is required to add more addresses is to add a new subnet in the Bridge Domain; there is no VLAN configuration and trunking associated with increasing the IP space.

#### Tenant Policy

The Tenant Policy objects are related to the network objects, but these objects are more focused on the policies and services the endpoints receive. The Tenant Policy consists of Application Profiles, End Point Groups, Contracts, and Filters.  These are all new and ACI specific terms.

![Tenant Policy](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/tenant_policy.png)

*  An **Application Profile** is a container for End Point Groups (EPGs). The Application Profile is used as an identifier for Applications, and allows for separation of adminstrative privileges and security access in/out of the EPG.  As an example, if you had a 3-Tier application such as web, app, and db, it would be separated into three separate EPGs
*  An **End Point Group (EPG)** is a collection of endpoints that have the same services and policies applied. EPGs define the switchports, virtual switches, and VLAN/VXLAN/NVGRE encapsulations associated with an application service. Each EPG can only be related to one Bridge Domain, so all hosts in the same EPG must use IP addresses within a subnet assigned to the Bridge Domain. If the Bridge Domain is configured with more than one subnet, the hosts can belong to different subnets.
*  **Contracts** define the services and policies applied to the end points in an EPG. Contracts can be used for service redirection to an L4-L7 device, assign QoS values, and to apply ACL rules. Contracts are used in a "provider" and "consumer" relationship. The EPG that offers the services **provides** the contract, and the EPGs that need to use the service **consume** the contract.
*  **Filters** are the objects that define protocols (tcp, udp, icmp, etc.) and ports. Filter objects can contain multiple protocols and ports, and Contracts can consume multiple Filters.

![Tenant Example](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/tenant_example.png)

The above diagram connects the Tenant Networking and Policy elements together:

*  Each white box is a child of "Example" Tenant
    -  Networking (VRFs, Bridge Domains, and L3 Externals)
    -  Policy (Filters, Contracts, and Applictions)
*  Each blue box is an object of the specified type
    -  The orange text is the object's name
    -  Quotes indicate a relationship with another object type
*   Each red box is a child of its encompassing blue box object
    -   Subnets are child objects of Bridge Domains
    -   L3Paths and Networks are child objects of L3Externals
    -   EPGs are children of Applications
*   Each circle represents a relationship between an EPG or L3 External Network and a Contract object.

In this example, the Databases are **providing** the "DB" contract which means the Database EPG is providing services on tcp/1433. Since both the App and Web servers **consume** this contract, they are allowed to talk to the Databases on tcp/1433. The Web and App servers have their own specific contracts that they provide to allow users in the corporate network to consume their services. The L3 External Network is defined as 10.0.0.0/8, so only users with IP addresses in that range would be able to access the servers. Also, the L3 External Network is not consuming the "DB" contract, so they would be inaccessable from the corporate network.

Now that you have an understanding of the most common Tenant concepts, lets configure a few things in the APIC GUI.
