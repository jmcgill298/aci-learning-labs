### ACI Architecture
In NX-OS mode, the data center network has traditionally been implemented with a 3-tier architecture with Core, Aggregation/Distribution, and Access tiers. ACI uses a 2-tier model referred to as Leaf-Spine architecture also well-known as a folded Clos network.

> NXOS mode designs have also started to use 2-tier leaf-spine designs as well.

ACI is a Clos network, which has the following design principles:

*  Spine switches only connect to leaf switches
*  Leaf switches only connect to spines
*  Every leaf should connect to every spine
*  Hosts and other infrastructure devices should only connect to the leaf switches

The ACI Fabric automatically configures point-to-point L3 links between each Leaf/Spine connection and leverages overlay protocols such as VXLAN to allow for any endpoint to exist anywhere in the fabric, i.e. Layer 2 connections over a Layer 3 fabric. This type of architecture has significant benefits including the following:

*  Eliminates spanning-tree inside of the ACI Fabric.
*  Creates an ECMP network for more efficient use of all switch interconnects.
*  Converges faster when a network link fails.
*  Provides the ability to deploy a non-blocking fabric.
*  Connecting all leaf switches to all spine switches ensures all hosts inside the datacenter are within 1 hop from each other.
*  Allows mobility within the data center without requiring reconfiguration of the underlying infrastructure. Any IP address anywhere.
*  The VXLAN fabric normalizes end host encapsulation allowing hosts in the same Layer 2 domain to connect to the fabric using different Layer 2 encapsulation methods.

Here is an example packet flow in an ACI network:
![Packet Flow](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/packet_flow.png)

1.  Host A sends a packet to its gateway, which is the local leaf. Each local leaf always serves as the default gateway.
2.  The incoming packet is stripped of any layer 2 header information
3.  The leaf does a lookup on the destination address:
  *  If the destination host is directly connected to the leaf; the packet is re-encapsulated with the appropriate header, and forwarded to the destination address.
  *  If the destination host is connected to another leaf; the packet is encapsulated in VXLAN and forwarded to the destination VTEP address via the spine.
4.  The destination leaf removes the VXLAN header and does a lookup for the destination.
5.  A new layer 2 header is added based on what encapsulation the end host uses.

After hearing a little bit about ACI architecture, let's take a look at the core components of ACI and introduce a few ACI specific terms needed to be aware of as you start to program against an ACI fabric.
